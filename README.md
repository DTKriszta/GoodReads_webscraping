# GoodReads_webscraping
This Python scraper (only for learning purpose) downloads data from https://www.goodreads.com.

## Goal of this project
The aim of my work was to familiarize myself with the basics of **web scraping** and then to perform analyses on the extracted data. It was not my intention to perform a full analysis of all available data.
