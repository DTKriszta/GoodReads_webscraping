# GoodReads_webscraping
This Python scraper (only for learning purposes) downloads data from https://www.goodreads.com.

## Goal of this project
The aim of my work was to familiarize myself with the basics of **web scraping** and then to perform analyses on the extracted data. It was not my intention to perform a full analysis of all available data.

## Data languages used to solve this project
- **Jupyter Notebook**: scraping
- **PostgreSQL**: data preparation for analysis,  
                  data analysis
- **Google looker studio**: data visualization

## Results
See the details in my presentation which you can find in the repository of the project. The analyzes excluded from the presentation can be found in the SQL file, it is worth reviewing them as well.
